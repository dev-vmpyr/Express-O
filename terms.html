    any terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features, products or services we offer on the Service (collectively, this
    "Agreement"). If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, please do not use the Service. We may make changes to
    this Agreement and to the Service from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect changes in or requirements of the
    law, new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Service under Settings and also
    on goExpresso.com, and you should regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes
    include material changes to your rights or obligations, we will notify you at least 30 days in advance of the changes (unless we’re unable to do so
    under applicable law) by reasonable means, which could include notification through the Service or via email. If you continue to use the Service after
    the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.</p>

    prompted to confirm your purchase with the applicable payment provider, and your method of payment (be it your card or a third party account such as
    the Google Play Store or App Store) (your "Payment Method") will be charged for the in app purchase at the prices displayed to you for the service(s)

    applicable, to charge you. Auto-Renewal; Automatic Card Payment If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in app purchase,
    your Payment Method will continue to be billed for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again
    after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed
    to when subscribing. Your card payment information will be stored and subsequently used for the automatic card payments in accordance with the
    Agreement. Objections to a payment already made should be directed to Customer support if you were billed directly by Expresso or the relevant third
    party account such as the App Store. You are also able to object by contacting your bank or payment provider, who can provide further information on
    your rights as well as applicable time limits. You may unconditionally withdraw your consent to automatic card payments at any time by going to
    Settings on Expresso or the relevant third party account, but be advised that you are still obligated to pay any outstanding amounts. If you want to
    change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your third party account (or Settings on Expresso, if applicable) and follow the
    instructions to terminate or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Expresso

    subscription term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. Additional Terms that apply if you pay Expresso
    directly with your Payment Method. If you pay Expresso directly, Expresso may correct any billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has
    already requested or received payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, Expresso may
    terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion. Virtual Items. From time to time, you may be able to purchase or earn a limited, personal,

    that are exchangeable within the Service for virtual products (collectively, "Virtual Items"). Any Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not
    constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license. Virtual Items do not
    incur fees for non-use, however, the license granted to you in Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, when
    Expresso ceases providing the Service or your account is otherwise closed or terminated. Expresso, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to

    exercises any such rights. Virtual Items may only be redeemed through the Service. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE

    of similar effect. Please also include the email address or mobile number associated with your account along with your order number. This notice shall
    be sent to: Expresso, Attn: Cancellations, P.O. Box 25472, Dallas, Texas 75225, USA. If you use your right of cancellation (except for purchases made
    through your Apple ID, which Apple controls), we will refund (or ask Google to refund) all payments received from you, without undue delay and in any
    case within 14 days of the date when we received notice of your decision to cancel the Agreement. We shall make such refund using the same means of
    payment as used by you in the initial transaction. In any case, no fees will be charged to you as a result of the refund. If you made a purchase
    through a payment platform not listed above, please request a refund directly from the third-party merchant through which you made your purchase. You
    cannot cancel an order for delivery of digital content that is not delivered on a physical medium if order processing has begun with your explicit
    prior consent and acknowledgement that you will thereby lose your right of cancellation. This applies, e.g., to purchases of Virtual Items. That means
    that such purchases are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. Pricing. Expresso operates a global business, and our pricing varies by a number of factors. We
    frequently offer promotional rates - which can vary based on region, length of subscription, bundle size and more. We also regularly test new features
